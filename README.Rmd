# bloodstats

A dummy package for demo and testing. 

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# # Install devtools if you don't have it already
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mariakalimeri/bloodstats")
```


## Examples

```{r, eval = FALSE}
data.frame(var1 = c(1, 2, 3), var2 = c(4, 5, 6)) %>%
  bloodstats::bloodmeans()
 ``
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
